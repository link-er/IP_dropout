# Information Plane Analysis for Dropout Neural Networks

This is the official implementation repository for [Information Plane Analysis for Dropout Neural Networks (Adilova, Geiger, Fischer, ICLR 2023)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bQB6qozaBw). 
There are training procedures for CIFAR10 and MNIST experiments, each of which includes the script for training itself and Jupyter notebook for plotting information planes after training.
There is also a script for the checkup of the properties of the estimator under multiplicative Gaussian noise (estimator_validation folder).
MI estimators include NPEET from https://github.com/gregversteeg/NPEET and EDGE from https://github.com/mrtnoshad/EDGE.
Dropout MI (dropout_MI.py) estimator is an implementation of the algorithm proposed in the paper.
